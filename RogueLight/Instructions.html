	<h1>What is Rogue Light?</h1>
	<p>
		Rogue Light is a <a href="https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2023">2023 Seven Day Roguelike Challenge</a> entry by <a href="http://edkolis.com">Ed Kolis</a>.
		It uses code from my 2021 7DRL, Found Magic, so it may bear similarity to that game.

	<h1>Losing the game</h1>
	<p>
		If your hitpoints ever reach zero, it's game over - simple as that!
	</p>

	<h1>Modding the game</h1>
	<p>
		You can modify the monsters that appear in the game - yeah, if one's too hard to beat, you can nerf it!
		Or if the game is too easy, you can make all the monsters tougher.
		Or just add your favorite geeky references so you can fight Frieza instead of Xaos!
	</p>
	<p>
		To do so, edit the MonsterTypes.json file in the Data folder.
		Be warned that there's not much error checking in the monster loading code, so make frequent backups in case you break something!
		Monsters will tend to appear mainly around the dungeon depth equal to their difficulty level.
		But there's always a chance for out of depth monsters! Be careful!
